Interface :
    An interface is a blueprint of a class. It has 
    static constants and abstract methods

    -> Interface mechanism can be used to achive abstraction
        in java.

    Reasons to use Interface: 
    -> abstraction
    -> functionallity of multiple inheritence.
    -> loose coupling. -->?
