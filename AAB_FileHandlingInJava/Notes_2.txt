=====
    java.io package in java has every class to handle I/O operations.

Stream :
======
    Sequence of Data.
    Two Types : 
        ->  Input Stream
        ->  Output Stream

On basis of Data Transfer Streams is divide into 
-> Byte Stream
-> Character Stream


Byte Stream:
===========
        It is only used to preform Byte ( 8 bites ) data through Input or Output.

        Example : Images , Character , Videos ,  Byte data , Audios.

        -> Classes used are FileInputStream (reads 1 byte at once ) ,
            FileOutputStream ( writes 1 byte at once ) .

        Reference :
            ->> ./CopyFileUsingByteStream

Character Stream:
================
        It is only used to preform Input and Outputs for 16 bit unicodes. 

        -> Classes used are FileReader ( reads 2 bytes at once ) ,
            FileWirter ( write 2 Bytes at once ) .  


Standard Stream:
===============
    [ InputStreamReader ] // used for console input
    Taking input form user and giving Output to user.

    1. Standard Input       [System.in]
    2. Standard Output      [System.out]
    3. Standard Error       [System.err]

    Reference :
        ->> ./ReadFromConsole.java

Reading and Writing Files:
=========================
    InputStream is used to read data form file 
    OutputStream is used to write into file

    InputStream : 
        1 -> FileInputStream
        2 -> ByteArrayInputStream
        3 -> FilterInputStream --------> BufferedInputStream
        4 -> ObjectInputStream      |__>
                                       >  DataInputStream

    OutputStream :
        1 -> FileInputStream
        2 -> ByteArrayOutputStream
        3 -> FilterOutputStream   ---------> BufferedOutputStream
        4 -> ObjectOutputStream         |___>
                                            >  DataOutputStream


Random File Access : 
==================
    java.io.RandomAccessFile, RandomAccessFile act as a large array of bytes stored 
    in a file Stream.
    
    RandomAccessFile class implements DataOutput , DataInput , Closeable interfaces.

    Constructors : 
        ->    RandomAccessFile(File file,String mode)
        ->    RandomAccessFile(String name,String mode)

    
File Class :
==========
        java.io.File

        -> Represents the file or directory path name.
